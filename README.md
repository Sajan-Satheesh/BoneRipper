In this game, the player plays as a bone-ripper who rips enemies and collects the bones.
1. At the start of the game, the player is spawned in a raft moving through the ocean. Once he reaches the nearest proximity to the enemy island, he has to jump to the island, and the level starts.
2. In each level, the player has to move toward enemies, hit them, and kill them.
3. The direction alone can be controlled using the cursor.
4. At the same time the player has to escape the arrows shot by the tower enemies and the tower enemies will be in an unreachable position.
5. The player has to find and move towards the final destination to pass the current level.
6. The bone collected during the rampage is counted towards the high score.

## üéπ Controls
> üñ±**Left mouse click** -> Player to jump from the raft.<br>

 3. Easy controls to navigate and play the game.

## üß© Implementations
1. Created a generic abstract pooling system, which is used to main multiple pools for bones, weapons, arrows, and jump path trailing.
2. Implemented scriptable objects to create data sets for shop items, the player, enemies, and the boat.
3. Used singleton pattern to run different services like GameServices, PlayerServices, EnemyServices, WeaponServices etc.
4. Implemented procedural generation scripts for island creation, so that each level iteration will have a unique place to play.
5. Island mesh created and unwrapped programmatically.
6. Created a shader graph(node-based) for the procedurally generated island, so that a blend of rock and grass textures can be applied.
7. Used Observer pattern to implement less coupled events.
8. Implemented many of the objects that have a lot of logic using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
